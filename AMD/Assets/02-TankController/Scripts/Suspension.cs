        //use the result of this ground check for the suspension spring
        //TIP: the tank is the moving part of the spring not the floor, draw the diagram
        //The tanks mass never changes either so is there any need to simulate forces in ForceMode.Force maybe ForceMode.Acceleration would keep the numbers smaller and easier to deal with????

        //to stop the tank from sliding you also need to conssider how much velocity is in the left/right direction and counter it here
